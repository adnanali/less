sometimes I wish I would just face that fear,
but don't we all have our bones to pick?
though sometimes I wish I could just disappear,
would that not be my greatest trick?

but I want to be here, there's much to see,
moments I have not yet met.
I think if I would just share more of me,
that would be my greatest effect.
