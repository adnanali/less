if all your words were in a &lt;div&gt;
I would style them with &lt;em&gt;phasis
I would take even the weak points
and mark them &lt;strong&gt;
I would put them all front and centre
with {margin: 0px auto;}
and I would put around them
a blue dashed border with a width of one
though if all my words were in a &lt;div&gt;
I would style them with {display: none;}
