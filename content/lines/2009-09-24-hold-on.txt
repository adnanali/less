what in/the hell
is free verse?

this is why
poetry is such
a sham.

how the/in hell
can charles freaking
bu-
kows-
ki
take a couple
of (run-on)
sentences,

put
one, two
or three words
per line and
call it
poetry?

even kasparov has to
go the full distance
of the board
<i>every time</i>
before he can turn
a pawn into
a queen.

beauty, I suppose,
<i>is</i> in the eye
of the beholder.

it's just that
some of us
have to go through
many more eyes
before someone

holds on.
