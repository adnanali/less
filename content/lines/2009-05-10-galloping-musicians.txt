why not just throw a dagger at me?
as I hold my wound
and try and pull out this dagger
and it hurts
the pain hurts
and not just where the dagger hit
the pain travels, like horses galloping on my veins
this pain it hurts
I can feel each beat
of the horseshoes
leaving marks
but I could make music with those beats
the rhythm, they move with rhythm
they aren't horses, they're musicians
