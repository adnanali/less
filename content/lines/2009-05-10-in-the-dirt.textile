out on my daily grind
in the dirt a puzzling find
two round buttons in the grass
the choice to make, to take or pass?

what do I do with
the buttons in the dirt,
do I needle and sew,
and mend my shirt?
or stick the buttons on my eyes
and put cotton in my ears,
drown out the maddening cries --
hold back my tears?
