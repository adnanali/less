though we asked for just a letter,
from you, we had expected better
we want words
that will make our minds drift
and our hearts blink
but please, not words
from a printer's ink

jab tak haathoon mein hai jaan,
un haathoon se likh meri jaan
lafz jo dum se likhe ho
tere khalam se likhe ho.

(p.s. we're not asking for
a song or a tune,
but now you must scent
the letter with perfume)
