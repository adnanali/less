I did not see the stars tonight
I blamed the city, I blamed the light
I blamed the weather, I blamed the fog
I blamed pollution, and I blamed the smog

I thought, where did we all go so wrong?
I thought, maybe I should write a sad song.
I thought, oh lord, why is the world so stuck-up?
but, in fact: I did not see the stars, because I did not look up
