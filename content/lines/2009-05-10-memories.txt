my old memories
are long gone and
I cannot make memories
for more than a day

every book I read
is like deja vu
a faint thread
a slight sense of connection
but that too falls
my memory fails me
but brings me
a new day everyday

in ways it is good
I can cry today
and not remember tomorrow
but I can love today
and not remember tomorrow
that thought hurts me today
but will not hurt me tomorrow

I am reborn every day
a reminder of death from yesterday
