might I make you laugh a little?
might I make you cry?
I just might spread your wings a little,
catch a glimpse of you in the sky.

--

a penny for your thoughts?
though a penny's not a lot.
not in all the world is copper mint
to match the way in which you think.

--

tell me where you are,
tell me where you've been
to take my mind off
the mess that I am in.

--

they have yet to make a pill
that betters all that ails us,
and for all the things we think to do
it's our lack of thought that fails us.

--

this is not the poem,
not the one you sought.
just scattered words here,
a conversation with thought.
