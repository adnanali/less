I await a day
where with a clear mind
I can read a book
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe, then again

a day
where with a rocking rhythm
I can strum a chord
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe, then again

a day
where with my echoes
I can sing a song
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe, then again

a day
where with simple words
I can write
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe, then again

a night
where with the clouds, the stars, the moon
I can breathe
and then again
and then again
and then again
and maybe then â€¦
