if all your words were in a &lt;div&gt;
I would style them with &lt;em&gt;*phasis*
I would take even the weak points
and **mark** them &lt;strong&gt;
I would put them all front and centre
with {margin: 0px auto;}
and I would wrap them with
a blue dashed border with a width of one
though if all my words were in a &lt;div&gt;
I would style them with <a id="none" href="#">{display: none;}</a>

<script type="text/javascript">
  $("#none").mouseover(function() {
    $('div').hide();
  });
</script>
