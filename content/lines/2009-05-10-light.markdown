I have no delusions
of light at the end of the tunnel.
I don't expect to get there.
God may have said,
"let there be light".
I say, "there need be none".
I have no delusions.
I roam in any direction
that my feet will lead me.
I carry nothing with me.
nothing here is mine.
only the journey...
maybe the journey is mine.
