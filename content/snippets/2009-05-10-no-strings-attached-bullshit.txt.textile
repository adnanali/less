"Harry, I had no idea!"

"Sure you didn't."

"That's uncalled for! I'm trying to look out for you."

"Yeah? You did a great job of that in the meeting."

"You're unbelievable. You can't keep pointing fingers at everyone else. God dammit Harry, you need to step up and take responsibility for your actions and your inaction. I've been doing a lot of damage control for you."

"Great good that did."

"What's your problem, Harry? Do you even realize the trouble you've got yourself into? You realize you're out of a job now?"

"Look, I never asked for your help and sure as hell didn't ask for your pity."

"You know what? This is bullshit. Fuck you Harry!"

"Whatever."

Samantha storms out of the room. The door receives no mercy from her as it closes with a resounding thud. She pays no attention to John, who is walking toward the meeting room with a box full Harry's personal belongings, as she walks right past him. 

"This is all your stuff. All the stuff I could find", John muddles around with the contents of the box. "Give me a call if you think I missed anything."

Harry responds with nothing but a nod.

"Come on Harry, it's time to go."
