*I'm outside. I hear the bell ring. I did not press it and I am in front of it. How is that even possible? I open the door. Smoke flows out of the house, I can't see anything inside. There is too much smoke. Against my better judgement I step inside. 

I know only from the sounds that chains are falling all around the house. Are they meant to fall on me? Why am I here? What am I looking for? I must find it.

If I was looking for something, where would I go? The furnace, or maybe the attic. I have to choose one. I feel like time is running out. I have to hurry. The attic.

This rotating staircase, the stairs never seem to end. I can barely see anything. Have I been here before? Do I know this house? Do I know these rooms?

The room to the left. I can access the attic from there. I have to be careful. There is no floor board here. I'm here. What am I looking for?

Oh shit! I'm hit. What the hell is this? Hell, I forgot about the chains. 

I'm falling. 

I can't do anything. I can't hold anything. The weight of the chains... I can barely breathe. 

I'm falling.

I'm falling.

I'm falling.*

Breathe! It's just a dream. It's nothing. Sometimes you fly and sometimes you fall. It's just a dream.
