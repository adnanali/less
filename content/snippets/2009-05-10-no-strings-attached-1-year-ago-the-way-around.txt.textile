Samantha opened the door that now read "Fire Ex", but everyone knew what it meant and everyone knew it wouldn't set off the alarm. She found Harry to her right. 

"Hey Sam, what's up?", said Harry, letting the ashes from his cigarette hit the ground.

"Don't start with me! I'm furious right now. Harry, you can't just mouth off like that in a meeting. You just can't."

"I think I just did."

"Yeah, you did. We're going to have to try real hard to dig out of this one. You're making things difficult."

"You know what? You're right. I'm sorry."

"Are you really?"

"Yeah, I am."

"Good, and can you blow the smoke in that direction?", said Samantha as she pointed away.

"Sorry."

"I had a dream about you the other day", said Samantha, in a calmer tone.

"Oh?"

"You were trapped, in chains."

"Hah, doesn't feel like a dream."

"But then you got out. You broke out of the chains."

"What do you think that means?"

"I don't know. I think it means you'll be fine. I think it means you'll find a way."

"I hope so", Harry pulled a cigarette half way and held the pack out toward Samantha.

"No", said Samantha, with a slightly irritated look on her face, "You know I quit a while ago."
