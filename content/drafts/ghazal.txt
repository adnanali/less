not a single star up there, no glimmers of moonlight
i could wait all day, but the sky will be rather plain tonight.

i think and think all day about the world around me
and i wonder how i will keep myself sane tonight.

some will spend the day with ease and joy
at the expense of those who will be in pain tonight.

tell me, while some will sing tunes of growling hunger,
how can some be sipping wine and then still complain tonight?

...  
drops will touch the ground, but there wil be no rain tonight

...  
don't fall asleep, adnan, let this moment not pass in vain tonight
