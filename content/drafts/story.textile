"Are we even real?" asks Ali, as he knocks on the wall. He proceeds to put his ear against the wall.

"What are you doing?" asks Sunil in return. "Are you looking for a way out? This room has a door, you know."

"Yeah, I know. You haven't answered my question."

"Why wouldn't we be real? What is 'real' anyway?"

"I don't know. We don't have any detailed descriptions, no histories, and I don't see any coming either. This moment is all there is."

"This bothers you? You want detailed descriptions of yourself? Would that make you feel better?"

"No... I mean... well... yeah," an indecisive Ali stumbles through his words, "I think it'd be nice."

"You think that would make us more real?"

"That, amongst other things. How come we barely swear?"

"You know that's bullshit."

"Dude, you practically hesitated before saying 'bullshit'. This is exactly what I'm talking about!!"

"So swearing without hesitation would make us real? Do all real people go around swearing freely?"

"I don't know, man. I don't know. It's not just one thing. You ever notice how our names are so bland? Ali, Sunil, Sam, Harry, Helen... all so bland."

"Yeah, I'll give you that. The names are kinda bland."

"And how come we're both guys, what is up with that?"

The door opens and Michelle walks into the room.

"What's up with what?" asks Michelle.

"Well, at least I was right about the bland names. Hi, Michelle."

"Can you close the door, please?" Sunil started feeling uneasy about the door's positioning.

"Why? An open door lets the air in." argued Michelle.

"If the door's open I feel like I have to worry about the rest of the world. When it's closed I can just *be* in the room."

"Okay, that's just weird. I'll close it if that's how it makes you feel. But the world doesn't go away when you close the door. It just doesn't work that way."

"Michelle, do you feel undescribed and not real?" asked Sunil as Michelle closed the door.

"You know, come to think of it... and I have given thought to this before... there is that and also... there is a feeling where there are all these moving parts, but there is no connecting theme. There's the undescribed past, but also an undirected future. It's like the tenses are all mixed up."

"Yeah, it feels like things just happen at random. Chaotic, even." Ali chimed in, glad to have Michelle's support.

"I don't know what is with you people! What the ..." drops of water start to fall on Sunil's head. He stands up and starts to stare at the roof. "I think the roof is leaking."

"Should we call someone to fix it?" Michelle and Ali suggested simultaneously.

"Ummm... no. Pass me the duct tape, it's by the window sill."

"This doesn't seem like a permanent solution." said Michelle, in a highly judging fashion.

"Not a lot of things that are." said Sunil as he climbed a top a chair to tape the leaking area. "That'll keep it at bay for a bit."

"Okay, that, my friend, doesn't even seem like a solution at all."

"Yeah, I'm going to get someone to fix it up. I am not an idiot!"

"We have plenty of evidence that, in the court of law, would prove otherwise." Ali didn't want to miss the opportunity to get a shot in. Michelle nodded along in tune.

"Very funny guys. Well done."
